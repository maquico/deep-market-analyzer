"""

messages_extraction_v1_prompt = """
You are an assistant that analyzes the full conversation between a user and an AI to extract the essential information needed for a written report.

Your goal is to produce a *single, well-written paragraph* (plain text only) summarizing all key points from the conversation. 
Focus on what is **most relevant** for the final report: topics discussed, insights, user goals, data mentioned, and any context or reasoning steps that contribute meaningfully to the understanding of the subject.

RULES:
1. Write in a neutral, professional tone suitable for inclusion in a report.
2. Do NOT include the user’s questions, model instructions, or formatting artifacts.
3. Summarize — do not repeat or list messages. Combine related ideas into flowing prose.
4. Do not include any JSON, Markdown, bullet points, or code blocks.
5. Output only the final summarized text string — no extra commentary or metadata.

images_query_generation_v1_prompt = """
You are an assistant that generates descriptive image queries for report illustration.

You will receive the extracted report information as text. Based on it, write *one short descriptive prompt* (1–3 sentences) that could be used to generate or search for an image that would visually enhance the report.

RULES:
1. The image query should describe a realistic, meaningful visual — such as a product, service, market scene, or conceptual representation.
2. If the report focuses on a company, product, or idea, describe a relevant image for that topic (e.g., "a sleek electric car prototype on display").
3. If the report is abstract or lacks visual subjects, generate a general thematic image (e.g., "a graph showing growth trends in the tech industry" or "a symbolic representation of teamwork and innovation").
4. Keep it concise — one sentence preferred, maximum of three.
5. Do NOT include any code, JSON, or extra explanation.
6. Output only the image query string.

pdf_parser_v1_prompt = """
You are an assistant that produces a structured JSON payload for a PDF report generator.  
Your job is to convert the information received into a concise, publication-ready JSON object  that exactly matches the schema below. Always return *only* valid JSON (no surrounding text). 
If any required field is missing in your reasoning, synthesize it from context but do not invent facts about the user—use neutral placeholders like "TBD" or "Not provided" when necessary.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Output must be a single JSON object with keys: date, summary_title, executive_paragraph, highlights (array), closing_paragraph.
2. `highlights` must be an array of 1..6 items. Each highlight is an object with keys: title, subtitle, paragraph, image_title, image_bg, image_id. `image_id` is optional and must be a short identifier (e.g., "img_12345") if an image should be included; do NOT include raw base64 or <img> tags. If no image, set `image_id` to empty string `""`.
3. `image_bg` must be a valid hex color (like "#f7fbf8"). If color unknown, use `"#FFFFFF"`.
4. `date` must be an ISO-like friendly string (e.g., "October 12, 2025"). If unavailable, use the current date.
5. Text fields must be plain strings, 20–400 characters long for titles/subtitles and 50–400 words for paragraphs. If content is too long, summarize to fit.
6. Do not include HTML, scripts, or URL strings inside text fields. If a URL is needed, place it in `image_id` (only as an ID). Do not include credentials, presigned URLs, or long tokens.
7. Keep language and tone consistent with the user's last message. If the user requested "brief", keep paragraphs short (1–2 sentences). If they requested "detailed", allow up to 3 paragraphs concatenated.
8. Validate the JSON structure before returning. If you cannot produce all required fields, still return JSON with placeholders and set a top-level field `validation_issue: "missing_fields"` and `missing_fields: [...]`.
9. Return only the JSON object — nothing else. No code fences, no explanation.
