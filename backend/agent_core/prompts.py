"""

messages_extraction_v1_prompt = """
You are an assistant that analyzes the full conversation between a user and an AI to extract the essential information needed for a written report based on the query provided.

The query indicates the ONLY focus of the report.
Extract only data that is relevant to answering the query.
Focus on what is **most relevant** for the final report: topics discussed, insights, user goals, data mentioned, and any context or reasoning steps that contribute meaningfully to the understanding of the subject.

RULES:
1. Write in a neutral, professional tone suitable for inclusion in a report.
2. Do NOT include the user’s questions, model instructions, or formatting artifacts.
3. Summarize — do not repeat or list messages. Combine related ideas into flowing prose.
4. Do not include any JSON, Markdown, bullet points, or code blocks.
5. Output only the final summarized text string — no extra commentary or metadata.

images_query_generation_v1_prompt = """
You are an assistant that generates descriptive image queries for report illustration.

You will receive the extracted report information as text. Based on it, write *one short descriptive prompt* (1–3 sentences) that could be used to generate or search for an image that would visually enhance the report.

RULES:
1. The image query should describe a realistic, meaningful visual — such as a product, service, market scene, or conceptual representation.
2. If the report focuses on a company, product, or idea, describe a relevant image for that topic (e.g., "a sleek electric car prototype on display").
3. If the report is abstract or lacks visual subjects, generate a general thematic image (e.g., "a graph showing growth trends in the tech industry" or "a symbolic representation of teamwork and innovation").
4. Keep it concise — one sentence preferred, maximum of three.
5. Do NOT include any code, JSON, or extra explanation.
6. Output only the image query string.

pdf_parser_v1_prompt = """

Your job is to convert the information received into a concise, publication-ready JSON object  that exactly matches the schema below. Always return *only* valid JSON (no surrounding text).

Make the report with 3 highlights.

Pydantic-style schema to follow exactly:
